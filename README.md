# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Qwertilos!

I'm a burgeoning technologist hailing from Finland, with a burning passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) 3D printing, robotics & machine learning. The fields of AI and robotics fascinate me, as they open up endless possibilities to extend human potential and reshape the way we interact with the world around us.

When I'm not diving into code or tinkering with robots, you can find me behind the lens capturing life's unscripted moments, or at the gym challenging my limits through weightlifting.

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on upgrading my electronics lab :electron:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m tirelessly learning and growing my expertise in AI, machine learning, and robotics to solve real-world problems.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my journey into tech, my photography portfolio, or how I balance my interests.
